10/10/2012:
- Added basic single scattering integrator using direct light sampling.
- Added a XORShift based random number generator.
- Still working on getting a correct implementation of single scattering, rendering a Cornell box with a homogeneous medium is quite challenging.

14/10/2012:
- Added emission.

17/11/2012
- Reimplemented single scattering, it is slow and the result is not yet satisfying...
- Single scattering seems to be working properly now

22/12/2012
- Added multiple scattering
- Added support for defining a medium as a sphere instead of an infinite one

- Experimenting with the Henyey-Greenstein's phase function. To my understanding, positive values of g generate forward scattering which results in volumetric caustics and similar effects, while a negative g will diminish the effect of scattering on the scene, and make the light source glow slightly. But  the inverse of that behavior is happening in my implementation, I can't figure out the problem yet...
